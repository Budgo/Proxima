# Proxima
Proxima is a Minehut RPG server that I've been working on since the summer of 2019.
Work is on and off, but I usually try to get on at least once a day.

You can use any of the skripts here for any purpose, just please credit me publically
if you do so.
(example: add a hologram line somewhere that credits me (JackJack33))

When I finish skripting Proxima, I'll release all of these skripts as finalized versions for
anyone to use. I will also probably create a compact version as a single .sk file. Along with this I will
create a sort of documentation on how to use the skripts to create your own rpg.

Feel free to make any pull requests and help me bugfix, or just yell at me for my
terrible skripting.
